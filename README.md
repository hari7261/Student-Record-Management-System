# Student Record Management System

This is a simple Python program that serves as a student record management system. It allows users to perform various operations on student records, including adding, displaying, updating, and deleting student information. The program is menu-driven and provides an interactive way to manage student data.

## Features

1. **Add Student Record**: You can add a new student record by providing the student's ID, name, and score. The data is stored in a text file named "students.txt."

2. **Display Student Records**: This option displays all existing student records stored in "students.txt." It provides information about each student's ID, name, and score.

3. **Update Student Record**: You can update a student's score by entering their ID and the new score. If the student ID is found in the records, the program will update the score.

4. **Delete Student Record**: To remove a student's record, you need to provide the student's ID. If the ID exists in the records, the program will delete that student's record.

5. **Quit**: You can exit the program when you're done managing student records.
